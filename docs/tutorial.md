Townsquare is built around **events**, which are attended by **volunteers**. A **session** is a record of volunteer attendance or participation in an event.

Townsquare assumes you collect participation information with a sign-in sheet or have a person managing check-in. Using the default roles, only "volunteer manager" and "staff" roles may create events or track participation.

## Create an event

First, create an event by clicking the "+" icon in the top navigation bar:

![Click plus icon][1]

Create an event: What kind of event was it? When did  it start and end? Where did it happen? Are there any notes about the proceedings?:

![Create event][2]

Click "save". Now you're ready to start tracking participation.

## Creating sessions

Start typing a user name:

![User search][3]

Set hours and the role played by the volunteer:

![Set hours][4]

To override the duration calculated from reported hours, click the override duration button:

![Override duration][5]

## Searching for volunteers

Click the "volunteers" button and type all or part of a name: This should also work decently from smartphones.
